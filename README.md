It is kind of surprised to me that most flight scheduling app today does not come with the flight simulation functionalities. 
These apps are just overwhelming user with the flight informations. With flight simulation included, users can become more engaged with their trips. 
My friend Leo and I created a full stack web app that allows the users to book their flight tickets and when they goto their orders page, 
they have a chance to both view flights info and play flight simulation on an interactive map. Please check out our app which is hosted on heroku!
