# TravelExpert

- Travel Expert is your next flight scheduling app! It is a full stack web applicaiton dedicated to make flight scheduling less overwhelming and more fun. It is less overwhelming because rather than showing separated flight tickets information in a list view, Traverl Expert merges flights tickets information into a sequence for better viewing experience. It is more fun because each user can play simulation for their corresponding flight schedule.  

- Main Challenges:
  - Merging flight tickets by the use of DFS algorithm.
  - Implementing flight simulation between destinations by calling the animation function recursively.
