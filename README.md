- Most flight scheduling apps today are overwhelming users with the seperated flight informations and they usually do not come with the flight simulation functionalities. I personally do not have a good user experience with that. 

- My friend Leo and I created a full stack web app that allows the users to book their flight tickets and when they goto their orders page, 
they can view their flights being connected and play flight simulation on an interactive map. 

- Main Challenges:
1. Generated connected flight schedule by the use of DFS algorithm.
2. Implemented flight simulation between destinations in an interactive map by calling the animation function recursively.
